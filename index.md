Hey, I'm **Brandon Cardoso**, from Toronto. Currently in Tokyo.

I'm passionate about helping people communicate with each other and the world around them, as well as 'creating' in general. From baking and building a custom mechanical keyboard, to pottery, and whatever other project crosses my mind, I'm always looking for something new to create.

Some things I enjoy in my free time are baking, power-lifting, photography, travelling, video games and board games.
