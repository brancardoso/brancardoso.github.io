        Bot Bros is a 'family' of automated trading bots for the online game
        Team Fortress 2.
        <br /><br />
        Team Fortress 2 is a game with a special place in my heart. It introduced
        me to the simple economic concept of supply and demand. After spending
        lots of free time trading with other players, and seeing the success of
        automated trading services, my friend and I decided to implement our own.
        We created a database of thousands of items and their prices which were
        automatically updated from a community driven pricing API, inventory
        management logic, and a simple text chat interface for users.
        <br /><br />
        To date, we have served over 15,000 users and completed over 5,000,000 trades.

    title: Other Amazon

        A small Google Chrome extension to quickly check other Amazon locales to find
        more reviews and compare prices.
        <br /><br />
        Sometimes items on Amazon.ca would not have many reviews, be unavailable, or
        even be cheaper to order and import from the US. So I created this extention
        to quickly switch to the Amazon.com product page of whatever product I was looking at.
