I feel like my skills as a software engineer have stagnated recently, and I've sort of lost my way. I want to change
that. I will change that. I want to document what I've learned, what I plan on learning, and my thoughts on those things
in a way that I can reflect on later. I want to keep myself accountable, and hopefully these posts can help others who
find themselves feeling the same way.

At this point in my career, I have around 7 years of experience working as a software engineer. I've worked at a small
startup with only 4-5 other developers, a large corporation with several hundred developers on separate teams, and now
at a medium sized company with ~50 developers and more closely knit teams. At some point in the last year or two, I've
developed imposter syndrome. It feels like those around me are more knowledgeable, have a better understanding of what
is going on and at any moment they'll realize I don't belong. From talking with my software engineer friends and
co-workers, this is a fairly common feeling, but... how do you fix it?

When you start working in a real company, there are so many new technologies and concepts you are exposed to, and if you
don't spend the appropriate time to learn them you slowly feel like you're drowning. You get stuck with thoughts like
"should I know this already?", "I don't know this, should I ask?", and "why does everyone else seem to know this except
me?". There is so much in a real work environment that isn't taught in school, and it's up to you to learn those things.

Imposter syndrome comes from a lack of self-confidence. A lack of self-confidence comes from not properly understanding
what you are doing. I haven't put in the time to fully understand what it means to be a professional software engineer.
So that is what I'm going to do. I am going to research, read, and practice to fill the gaps in my knowledge, and do
what is necessary to become a better, more professional, software engineer.

## What's Next?
I think my general code writing skills are pretty good, but I've never put deliberate effort in to learning and
understanding clean coding practices. So to start, I will be reading [_Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software_ by
Robert Martin](https://amzn.to/3Ef9Ace). It goes over a lot of principles and concepts for writing code that is easy to
read, understand, extend, and maintain.
